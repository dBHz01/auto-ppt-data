Subfigure (b) figure is the same as Subfigure (a) except for a hand drawn trail near Point 2. And there is an arrow pointing to it with text “Gesture”. Subfigure (c) is similar to Subfigure (a), but there is no point in it. There is a new Circle at the position of Point 2, and a line connecting Shape 3 and this circle. We call it Shape 4. Meanwhile, there is a line connecting Shape 1 and Shape 2. There is a dotted line on the upper bound of Shape 3 and Shape 4, and a dotted line on the lower bound of them too. Subfigure (d) is similar to Subfigure (c), but Shape 4 move to the position below Shape 2. There is no solid line in this figure, but there are more dotted lines. There is a dotted line on the left bound of Shape 2 and Shape 4, and a dotted line on the right bound of them too.
